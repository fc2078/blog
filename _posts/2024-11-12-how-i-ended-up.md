# How I Ended up with Computers and Technology
Welcome to a place where I have a story to tell. You'll want to sit down if you've been acquianted with computer science and technology for quite a long time now, no matter how basic or advanced you know. It might be a common field of interest among people like me, but I'm glad that I have ended up here.

## Where did it all begin?
I started playing some games on the new Dell desktop my dad brough in 2010. It was the first computer I have ever used in my life. He set up our usename and password to be a **comination of my name and my sister's.** He used the computer for important tasks, while me and my sister played some small games when we were allowed to.

From the good ol' Windows 7 games that came along with the operating system to online `nick.jr` games, we really enjoyed the times. Sometimes my dad would save our old photos and videos on that computer and review them with the whole family. I saw how he was able to run programs on that desktop computer and learned many things from that.

### Using the computer myself
Since we had a **tower desktop**, there were two steps to starting up the computer. First, switch on the monitor. Next, bend down and press that bouncy button to start up the machine and hear those fans and drives run. Next, I sit through the `BIOS` and `Windows 7` startup screens. Then, I am welcomed and prompted to enter the password. Finally, I'm in the system and can do anything I want.

I would go online and play games from my favorite TV channels. Sometimes I would go to Google and search some random funny stuff up. Other times I would play `Purpble Place`, which was one of the nostalgic games that came with Windows 7

### Watching and using TV

I've also learned about **using the TV**. We had a cable box that used a **card for memory** and allowing for the box to run. Now, this was where some conflicts began. I would get in trouble simply for removing that card for whatever reason. And if I were to get punished, my mom would remove that card for the time being. It was quite the experience.

Regardless, I enjoyed watching some shows on the TV and learned how to switch between different channels and TV inputs, in the case I wanted to watch DVDs. I also learned how to use the home theater system, which was a beast for its time.

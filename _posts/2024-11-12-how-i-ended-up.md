# How I Ended up with Computers and Technology
Welcome to a place where I have a story to tell. You'll want to sit down if you've been acquianted with computer science and technology for quite a long time now, no matter how basic or advanced you know. It might be a common field of interest among people like me, but I'm glad that I have ended up here.

## Where did it all begin?
I started playing some games on the new Dell desktop my dad brough in 2010. It was the first computer I have ever used in my life. He set up our usename and password to be a comination of my name and my sister's.

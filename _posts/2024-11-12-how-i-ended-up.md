# How I Ended up with Computers and Technology
Welcome to a place where I have a story to tell. You'll definitely want to sit down if you've been acquianted with computer science and technology for quite a long time now, no matter how basic or advanced you know. It might be a common field of interest among people like me, but I'm glad that I have ended up here.

## Where did it all begin?
I started playing some games on the new Dell desktop my dad brough in 2010. It was the first computer I have ever used in my life. He set up our username and password to be a **comination of my name and my sister's.** He used the computer for important tasks, while me and my sister played some small games when we were allowed to.

From the good ol' Windows 7 games that came along with the operating system to online `nick.jr` games, we really enjoyed the times. Sometimes my dad would save our old photos and videos on that computer and review them with the whole family. I saw how he was able to run programs on that desktop computer and learned many things from that.

### Using the computer myself
Since we had a **tower desktop**, there were two steps to starting up the computer. First, switch on the monitor. Next, bend down and press that bouncy button to start up the machine and hear those fans and drives run. Next, I sit through the `BIOS` and `Windows 7` startup screens. Then, I am welcomed and prompted to enter the password. Finally, I'm in the system and can do anything I want.

I would go online and play games from my favorite TV channels. Sometimes I would go to Google and search some random funny stuff up. Other times I would play `Purble Place`, which was one of the nostalgic games that came with Windows 7.

### Watching and using TV

I've also learned about **using the TV**. We had a cable box that used a **card for memory** and allowing for the box to run. Now, this was where some conflicts began. I would get in trouble simply for removing that card for whatever reason. And if I were to get punished, my mom would remove that card for the time being. It was quite the experience.

Regardless, I enjoyed watching some shows on the TV and learned how to switch between different channels and TV inputs, in the case I wanted to watch DVDs. I also learned how to use the home theater system, which was a beast for its time.

## Moving forward with technology
As the years have passed by, I have grown more fond of and more familiar with technology. I've started using computers at school for research, assignments, and other fun things. I've learned about more games such as `Minecraft` and `Tanki Online`, and then `Roblox`. 

### Networks

I've also understood a little more about networks and ethernet ports, considering that our built-in RJ45 port got fried in a thunderstorm surge. My dad had to buy an external ethernet-USB adapter to get our computer back on the internet again. Alongside, I've discovered our Wi-Fi and gained it's SSID and key.

### The iPad

It was 2015, and me and my sister were asking our parents to get us an **iPad** to play with and do more with it. After some *technical difficulties* in the start, we have progressed far with it. I've discovered so many mobile games and enjoyed them, and looked up so many things I could use.

That was the *first* time I've actually got my hands on a mobile device. Until then, all I would do was merely look around and see what my parents and others would do on them. 

### Further Windows Antics

I've enjoyed using more software on our computer, such as `Word 2009` (we have not updated since purchasing the computer), `Control Panel`, `Notepad`, and some other tools exclusive to Windows. From then I have become quite a professional at using that operating system and getting more acquianted with technology.

I've started writing some fictional stories using `Word 2009` and saving them on my computer. My dad got me started with the basics and I was able to take over for the rest. I would open each document up and write the silliest or most attention-grabbing things.

I've also started playing `Roblox` on my old PC in 2017. Moving on from the iPad, I was able to play more games that were exclusive to desktop. Though not suited for gaming, I was able to move through with some games since they didn't take up as much resources back then.

Some games, such as `Prison Life`, were more playable on mobile due to more support for controls and keyboard hotkeys. That was what I enjoyed about playing on PC. I got more acquainted with PC gaming from there.

## Middle School
For a 6th grade assignment, we were required to write a paper about a subject. We could either hand-write it, or otherwise use a word processor and print it out. My teachers gave us instructions on saving files, and I was keen of following those instructions and getting it all typed out.

I typed out the assignment accordingly, and with a thumb drive my cousin has bought for me, I saved the file to there and brought it over for printing. I've learned that there was a process for using portable drives such as that. You hit `Save` first, but before removing it from the computer, you open up the tray, right click on the drive, hit `Eject`, wait for the confirmation, then pull it out. That way you could ensure taht all data processing is over and the drive can be safely removing without data loss.

In the summer of 2019, I joined a free program which involves STEM. There were more classes that I've participated in than STEM, but there's many takeaways I can recall. Sometimes we would code with `Scratch` code blocks and sometimes played `Minecraft Education`. Other times we learned some things that work with computersr. On those chill, free days, we would play games on the glorious site of `CoolMathGames` and relax.

### My first laptop and phone
**December 2019:** My dad got me a new laptop as I started to grow more mature and start doing work more conveniently, considering that my old desktop is running slow since its hardware is becoming outdated. I started having fun with it.

**February 2020:** Behold, my first phone! Acquiring the iPhone 8 Plus that I still keep to this day. This was (one of) the day(s) that I had become more independent than before. I can now do much more from about anywhere, and my parents won't have to worry about me or my sister if we're ever outside. A new piece of technology, right in my pocket!

### The break of the Pandemic
Then came the pandemic. We were home since March 2020, and since then, we were stuck with devices to learn and do other things with. I had my new laptop and iPad to work with and play games on. It sounded like fun at first, but as we were stuck with the same stuff over time, it grew boring.

But then that's when I started to learn more about PC parts and how they work together. I started looking at PC builds and other related antics. I also tore down my old desktop to see what's inside, how to dissemble it, and how to resemble it. It wasn't all easy work, but it was in fact, manageable. I've also understood a little more on networking with a desktop.

## How it all sums up
Here I am now in high school, **pursuing technology, becoming a better user, and assisting others.** My interests might have taken me to places of hard work, but of the *good* kind. I've learning coding/programming and have ended up using technology daily for my school, work, and many other purposes.

I would be in a **dystopian world** of myself if I weren't to know this much about technology. Even though I could imagine how life would be if I didn't use as much technology, or not even be as acquianted, it's a life I **DO NOT** want to be in.

Now I'm moving on to pursuing `Computer Science` in college soon and shall prepare for the real life experience of... life. Let me use everything I can from my `Fullstack Development` class to make changes and aid my education. And let me use my previous knowledge to move forward.

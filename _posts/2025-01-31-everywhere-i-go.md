# Everywhere I go 
## Every Journey, Big or Small
I have a passion for travel. Whether to new places or somewhere I've been that I love visiting. And every time I would want to go somewhere, it would typically be by **public transit** and a relatively **far distance**. 

Even if my family lived in a place *partially* isolated from the city, we were still apart of it and I would take full advantage of it.

I have studied my maps and geography well over the years. I know my roads, transit routes, and places by heart. I would never get lost and help my fellows get through, and that's how I would proceed with my journeys.

## Personal Runs
The family would go places during days off and vacations. I miss the times where we'd drive long distances and visit extended family or enjoy places. 

I would be the "navigator man" helping my dad through the roads, as well as other members who are with us if it is a joint journey. I was firm with the routing and would always be aware of the road and route conditions.

I can tell you right now that I give directions to my cousin's house in Philadelphia **without a GPS.**

### One with the Driver
Many times I got front seat rides. I would always be on the lookout and get the "real feel" of the road and driver. With that and countless hours of driving simulators, I feel more than ready to take the wheel myself.

## School
The usual journey. I only rode the city bus once in 8th grade to complete a test before starting my **new routine** in high school. I would get dropped off at the bus stop, and take the bus to school. Then back to the bus stop I cam from and transfer to another to take me home. 

I started taking the **subway** instead of the bus to speed up my commute and help me catch my bus home. This proved to be really efficient and faster. Later on I started taking the **subway** since I joined a CTE program.

## The Bigger Deal
After getting used to transit to and from school, I started embarking on journeys myself. **THIS** is where the bigger fun started. 

With my knowledge of the NYC transit system and interest in photgraphing them, I went out places. After my usual leg out of the home neighborhood, the route was mine.

I typically didn't have a particular place of interest to travel to; only broad areas or boroughs. I travel to places far from home to experience the face of NYC I never had before.

As I went through, I photographed transit vehicles to remember where I've been and show off to others with similar interests. They varied depending on where I was and the time of day.

Sometimes the train or bus was close to arrival and the next one was far away. I was very much thankful for my **strong** legs for supporting me. I walked fast and even ran for them. 

I also didn't have much time to waste by walking, so I picked up the pace in order to catch more and travel further in a shorter period of time.

## Transit Journey Week
One week, I went all over NYC, and even into New Jersey for a few hours. I covered all five boroughs throughout the span of **five days**. I even visited Staten Island for the first day by transit.

At the end of day, I would get real tired, just enough to make me fall into a **deep sleep**.

### Monday
I went to the World Trade Center to board the PATH train. I wanted to try something new, so I did. I went to New Jersey for the first time by myself, and on a new means of travel. I went to Hoboken first, then Newark.

It was a good morning to see it all. I took the train back to the World Trade Center before heading on over to Eastchester in the Bronx, then on over to Pelham Bay Park. After that it was home time.

### Tuesday
Manhattan is the heart of the city. However, it was Midtown that takes the crown for being the peak because of tourism, and Downtown because everyone stands on business over there and its history. Downtown has a more beautiful design than Midtown.

But what about **me?** I'm a New Yorker who knows places. And such a person knows to go places other than those. I haven't stepped foot in the upper region of the borough in long.

I visited Washington Heights and the George Washington Bridge. I went further uptown to Marble Hill, which is still Manhattan, despite being apart of the New York State mainland and not Manhattan island.

Then I went to Times Square to transfer to another train to Queensboro Plaza, before transferring off at Astoria. I took a bus to LGA airport where I had my time there before catching another bus out and heading back to the subway.

Through the Manhattan bridge, I visited the west side of Brooklyn and out before heading back home.

### Wednesday
I went into Queens from Northeast Brooklyn. Through the north border of Bed-Stuy, through Broadway Junction, and into Cypress Hills.

Then I had a bit in Jamaica Center before turning around and heading to JFK airport to transfer buses. Next up, I headed out into East New York before going to Canarsie. 

I turned around to stop at Broadway Junction before going out on 14 St in Midtown Manhattan. It had a feeling of business even during the midday.

And from there I went to South Ferry before turning around and heading back to my quarters.

### Thursday
West Farms in the Bronx was where decided my first spot. I went there, photographed what I normally do, then went to Harlem for the same thing.

I took a bus back into the Bronx. I explored the Hub `(3 Av-149 St)` and then took a train to Grand Central.

Low and behold, my first time riding the Long Island Railroad. It was only about 25 minutes to Jamaica. Thankfully, a CityTicket was $5.00 so I took it to Jamaica before going back home.

That time the new Madison concourse recently opened and full schedules weren't in place yet, so shuttles ran between the station and Jamaica.

### Friday
Finally, I decided to conclude the week with a special surprise: The ferry to Staten Island. I took it from South Ferry at the lowest tip of Manhattan. Then I took the railway after docking at St. George and went to Eltingville.

However, as the commute itself took a long time, I didn't have much time to explore, so with the remaining time, I took a bus back into Brooklyn via the Verrazano Bridge and right into Bay Ridge. Then I went to Bensonhurst, and then headed home from there.

It was a wild experience, and it was fun. It goes to show how I can embrace what I know and can do to enjoy something, and learn a lot of things to.

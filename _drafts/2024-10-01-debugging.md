# Debugging my Life
## What is debugging?
"Debugging" is a term commonly used by programmers and developers to describe the act of looking for errors in code and correct them. By doing so, they are removing "bugs", or errors from their app. 

### Where did it come from and why?

"Bugs" have been used as the term since the first case originated from a real-life insect. A moth lodged in the machine's hardware was discovered by engineers working on Harvard University's Mark II Aiken Relay Calculator in 1947.

The engineers have settled on calling this error a "bug" after literally finding one causing an issue in their machine, and named the process of troubleshooting such errors as "debugging".

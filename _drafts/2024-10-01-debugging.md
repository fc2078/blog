### Where did it come from and why?

**Bugs** have been used as the term since the first case originated from a real-life insect. A moth lodged in the machine's hardware was discovered by engineers working on Harvard University's Mark II Aiken Relay Calculator in 1947.

The engineers have settled on calling this error a "bug" after literally finding one causing an issue in their machine, and named the process of troubleshooting such errors as "debugging".
